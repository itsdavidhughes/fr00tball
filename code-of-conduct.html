              <h3>Please play nice</h3>

              <p>Standard soccer rules apply + <em>no slide tackles</em>. This is supposed to be fun. Nothing serious. Dont be <em>that</em> person.</p>

              <p>We are dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free fr00ball experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at fr00tball. Participants violating these rules may be banished <em>without warning</em> at the discretion of the event organisers.</p>

              

              <h3>More detail</h3>

              <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

              <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

      
              <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.</p>

              <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. Organisers can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>

              <p>Organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>

              <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at fr00tball and fr00tball-related social events.</p>
